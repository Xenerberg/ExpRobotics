The functions defined here are based on Literature available in A Mathematical Introduction to Robotic Manipulation (R. Murray, Zexiang Li, S. Shankar Sastry) and the blogpost of Travis DeWolf (https://studywolf.wordpress.com). The functions are based on Screw Theory which allows recursive creation of Robot Jacobian and fast computation. The Dynamics are based on the Lagrangian formulation.

The Matlab simulation files are linked with V-REP to simulate the results with a 6-DOF UR5 robot.
